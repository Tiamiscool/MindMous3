# MindMous3

MindMous3 is a Python-based program that utilizes hand-tracking technology to control the user's graphical user interface (GUI). Before you proceed, ensure to open the requirements file corresponding to your operating system.

## How it Works:

1. **OpenCV/cv2**: Opens the specified webcam.
2. **MediaPipe**: Detects hand landmarks.
3. **PyAutoGUI**: Moves the mouse according to the index finger's coordinates and executes clicks and other commands.

## How to Run:

1. Click on the requirements file for your operating system:
